Dear third-year students!<br>
I totally do not recommend even look at this repo for two reasons:<br>
1) my code quality at that time was quite bad =) so for such a mass as in this shell or other labs, you will receive bad marks
2) we are testing one of the best available plagiarism checking tools now, and this repo definitely will be among repos for testing =)
