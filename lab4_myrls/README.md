## Team

 - [Morhunenko Mykola](https://github.com/Myralllka)

## Prerequisites
- c++ boost lib 
## Installing
Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Myralllka/operating_systems.git
```
## Usage
From the root directory, launch the script
```
chmod +x ./compile.sh
./compile.sh
```
And the executable `myrls` file will be in the `./bin` directory.
```
./bin/myrls [path]
```
command will launch the program with path as an input. More then one parameter is a mistake. Zero parameters equivalent to `./`
